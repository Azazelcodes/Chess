# Chess
GUI based Chess game 

Hello!!
This is shlok again... I thought that after uploaoding a simple game, I upload a complex GUI based game so that you guys understand what it means to actually commint yourselves to a project and finish it.

Guys, but don't get scared from the lines and lenght of the code. It's currently way out of your knowledge rn.

Enough of that, talking about the project...

This project actually has a dataset which you need to download and open alongside the code or else your pieces will not load as they won't get the path for the images and even the moves will not work.
This code works on a set dataset and if one studies the 'book.txt' file which encompasses the moves. You might be able to put up a good fight..

Until next time, it's Azazel a.k.a Shlok..


Next respo might be a C or C++ project.
